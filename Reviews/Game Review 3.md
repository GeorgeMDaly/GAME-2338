## Details: 
  game title: Warframe
## Summary
  What is war frame. Warframe is an instanced mmo that was brought back from the brink of failure and over the past 2 to 3 years has resurged into greatness. Some would argue this game surpasses the quality of triple A games demolishing the concept of only good games are paid for. The game itself lives and thrives on randomly generated content to keep things just different enough for players to no think its stale. It has a microtransaction system that supports both players who don’t have enough time to play but enough money to buy in-game currencies/cosmetics and players who have too much time but no money to spend for in-game/currencies. It’s almost a perfect balance with how the player doesn’t feel forced to pay up to progress in the game because you can get everything and with how fair the prices are for MT’s. its free its open players love this game to bits with how much freedom they feel like they have. paying for their MT’s end up feeling more like a donation to them because of how much of a good deal the players KNOW they are getting.
	
  The gameplay its addicting one could get lost mixing and matching each and single combination of weapons, mods, frames, pets etc. for 1000s of hours like I have. There is so many weapons, borderlands level of so many weapons, you are bound to find a weapon that you will love. Tired of that old rifle? Switch it up with an electric flame thrower. Not liking the fire rate of your pistol? Get a new one that spits 100 in 5 seconds or dual wield for double the fun. Finding your blade not sharp enough? Get some gauntlets and beat your enemies to a pulp with ninja kicks. There are currently 36 warframes as of 2018 each with very different playstyles and a new one will be released hopefully later this year. 

  Every mission is pre-generated to keep the game feeling fresh and from going stale and they have in my opinion almost perfected this piece of the game. My animalistic joy center constantly gets excited every mission as I run through almost like a race with the other players to get the most kills or get to the end of the mission.
	
  Out of all the missions in a game about ninjas in space the stealthiest of them all is the spy mission type. The objective is to get to each control console 3 times without alerting the security and obtain precious data from the baddies. The rules stay mostly the same in that if gaurds are alerted in the room of the control console you have 1 minute to get the data before that control console is destroyed.
	
  Spy missions get a bad rap from most of the community in warframe and for good reason. Its just not fun playing with randoms who cant not alert the guards. Some 
## Final Thoughts
as a stealth game i give it a 3/5 in the end it feels more like a race against time instead of a heartpounding maticulous challenge from the shadows.
